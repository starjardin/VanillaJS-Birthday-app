# Readme update : Birthday app.

1. In this project, It does not really work properly, although some of the features are working but the truth to be told, not all of them are working. The new date of the new people does not seem to work properly. The filter and the select seem to a have a little problem, otherwise they are good.

1. If you had more time, I would probably work on the filter and cleaning up the code. At the moment, there is still no style, so styling it is what I would at the end of the day, it has bad looking. Mostly, I would definitely work on the new date of a new person. Finally, I would work out what is snaging me wiht the filter.

1. Yes, I learned something while I was doing this project, It was hot, I learned a bulk of subjects, methode about time especially. I am not sure but It seems that we can not assign (default export) variable to an imported file. I imported a globale variable by default but it gives bugs, so I needed change that into a name-export variable. We need to be carefull to choose very well when to use that.

1. Well, this one was not that easy but if I had to say what most challenging part was is dealing with the dates, tranforming time stamps into a real readable human date and then sorting it from to the nearest date, nightmare, although I like it. Playing puzzle.

1. Yes, I have a lot to say here. If you wouldn't mind explaining about the date-fns. Then, I am not sure if we can reassing a variable from a module files in another file. One thing I would like you to give a bit of explanation is this `parseInt()` method. I saw it on a website and what it said was it gives a string to a radical numeric number but I am not sure if I fully understood it. Local storage is still a bit blury.

1. Nothing much to say, the project was challenging which is pretty nice training, I liked it.
