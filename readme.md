# Birthday app description

1. This is a **CRUD** (Create Read Update and Delete) app practice in vanilla JavaScript.

1. One major point of doing this app was to endure and familiarize myself with array methodes such as `map` `filter` and `find`

1. After just having learned `fetch`, we did this app and it was a very nice opportunity to practice fetch.


## Experiments

During coding this app, I learned to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` specific elements in an html document by using vanila JavaScript. Ohter than that, I learned nice features of `ES6`in JavaScript such as `map`, `filter`,`find`and `distructuring` in JavaScript.
