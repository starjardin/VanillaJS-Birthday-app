# Birthday app description

1. This is a **CRUD**(Create Read Update and Delete) app practice in vanilla javascript.

1. One major point of doing this app was to endure and familiarize myself with array methodes such as `map` `filter` and `find`

1. After just having learned `fetch`, we did this app and it was a very nice opportunity to practice fetch.

1. Some styles are buit off bootsrap, Sometimes bootsrap is very nice because it is very responsive, that is why I used it here. I am style practicing using it as well and it never is a bad idea to try new things, at least for me.

## Experiments

During coding this app, I learned to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`a specific element in an html document by using vanila javascript. Ohter than that, I learned nice features of `ES6`in javascript such as `map`, `filter`,`find`and `distructuring` in javascript.
