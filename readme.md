1. I learned something while I was doing this project, It was tough but the most important thing is that I learned a lot of subjects, methode about time especially. I am not sure but It seems that we can not assign (default export) variable to an imported file. I imported a globale variable by default but it gives bugs, so I needed change that into a name-export variable. We need to be carefull to choose very well when to use that.

1. Well, this one was not that easy but if I had to say a thing, the most challenging part was to deal with the dates, tranforming time stamps into a real readable human date and then sorting it from to the nearest date, nightmare, although I liked it. It seemed as if I was playing puzzles.

1. Nothing much to say, the project was challenging which is pretty nice for training, I liked it.

# Birthday app description

1. This is a **CRUD**(Create Read Update and Delete) app practice in vanilla javascript.

1. One major point of doing this app was to endure and familiarize myself with array methodes such as `map` `filter` and `find`

1. After just having learned `fetch`, we did this app and it was a very nice opportunity to practice fetch.

1. Some styles are buit off bootsrap, Sometimes bootsrap is very nice because it is very responsive, that is why I used it here. I am style practicing using it as well and it never is a bad idea to try new things, at least for me.
